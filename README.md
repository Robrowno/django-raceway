# Django Raceway 

Django Raceway is a fictional motor-circuit in the UK with an extensive pedigree in racing and caters to those who love high-speed thrills and the smell of petrol and burnt rubber first thing in the morning!

Django Raceway, as a B2C business, aims to deliver personalised trackdays to motorsports enthusiasts at a state-of-the-art track with many challenging configurations. Users can register for an account, book track days, hire cars and book tuition to improve their car control and lap times. They can also request bespoke trackdays on behalf of a company or group, contact the business directly or sign up to a motorsports newsletter.

This is the right place for you if you are:
    - Looking to take your own car on a highly technical track
    - Looking to try out different driving experiences to command different kinds of sports cars
    - Looking to hire a car or reserve a bespoke track day for an event or group.

This is my fifth and final portfolio project for my Diploma in Software Development through Code Institute, where I am specialising in E-Commerce applications.

### Code Help:

The preliminary set up and an assisting walkthrough came in the form of following Code Institute's Boutique Ado walkthrough e-commerce project. Repository can be found here: [Boutique Ado - Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1)

I used the Bootstrap v5.0.2 framework to handle a lot of the heavy lifting of site styling and layout. 
The following from the documentation helped me:
- Navigation:
    - [Bootstrap 5 Navbar docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/)
    - [MD Bootstrap Navbar docs](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/navbar/#subsection-icons)
- Carousel:
    - [Bootstrap Carousel docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/)



I made use of Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) using their free student plan. 
All icons used in this project have come from here.
