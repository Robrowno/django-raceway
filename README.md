# Django Raceway 

Django Raceway is a fictional motor-circuit in the UK with an extensive pedigree in racing and caters to those who love high-speed thrills and the smell of petrol and burnt rubber first thing in the morning!

Django Raceway, as a B2C business, aims to deliver personalised trackdays to motorsports enthusiasts at a state-of-the-art track with many challenging configurations. Users can register for an account, book track days, hire cars and book tuition to improve their car control and lap times. They can also request bespoke trackdays on behalf of a company or group, contact the business directly or sign up to a motorsports newsletter.

This is the right place for you if you are:
    - Looking to take your own car on a highly technical track
    - Looking to try out different driving experiences to command different kinds of sports cars
    - Looking to hire a car or reserve a bespoke track day for an event or group.

This is my fifth and final portfolio project for my Diploma in Software Development through Code Institute, where I am specialising in E-Commerce applications.

## Wireframes and Planning

### Balsamiq wireframes/mockups
I used Balsamiq Wireframes to make mockups for the website and design how I initially imagined the site would look.

### Early Development

At the start of the project, even though I had the wireframes as versions of how I wanted the site to look, I more often than not made early mockup versions of the pages to quickly get the framework of the pages set up and to test whether I might like to do something another way or differently from the wireframes. 

Here is an early example of my home page, mocked up at the very start of the project. 
Key differences here include a carousel (which I would end up keeping) and the middle nav bar placed at the top of the page.
![Early Development Homepage](/static/images/readme-images/early-dev-homepage.png)

I started the project with the home page and nav bar, before installing django allauth and getting the base templates for that. From there, I began working one by one on each of the pages with purely static but fairly detailed to ensure I was happy with how things would look and could decide early-on if I wanted to make changes.


---

## User Experience (UX)

### B2C Strategy


### Agile Methodologies

To plan tasks to implement for my website, I used Github Projects, which is a Kanban style board to track your project progress. You can track user stories, epics, ideas, to-do items and you can all see what tasks have been completed.

I would also assign labels to different tasks, including sprints, milestones, and priority rankings (Must-have, Should-have, Won't-have, etc.). This would allow me to prioritise tasks and functionality accordingly.

You can see my project board [here](https://github.com/users/Robrowno/projects/4)

## Testing

Due to the size of the testing required, this can be found here: [Django Raceway Testing](TESTING.md)

---

## Bugs and Issues

- AWS Config: I was unable to deploy on Heroku thanks to a missing Variable in my User Groups that was spotted by Alan from Tutor Support. 

- I tried to use a for loop for my admin.py file to automate and speed up model registration. Whilst it sounded like a good idea in principal, it prevented me from adding list_display field options once they had been registered. I unregistered and re-registered the models to be able to do this.

- I had some early trouble getting my contact model to work correctly - I realised I had put incorrect 'name' attributes in my contact view. I also made changes in my contact model that required me to flush the database and remove previous migrations and to migrate again after.

- Bootstrap 5 toasts: I attempted to modify the bootstrap 4 toasts from the Boutique Ado walkthrough, whilst I was using Bootstrap 5.0.2 - This didn't work, and thanks to a snippet of code from Alan from Tutor support I was able to get it working again.


### Current Unresolved Bugs

- For some reason, the profile link in the nav bar (which appears to you once you log in) can appear to be unclickable. I have not yet found out why this is happening, but if you refresh the page, it resolves the issue every single time. 
I have also found out this can happen to the login link if you sign out. Again, refresh the page or click the Django Raceway logo and this will work as normal.

## Deployment

### Version Control:

- Version control was done through the Gitpod CLI, using the following key commands to push updated code to Github:
    - `git add ,` - to add all new files or file changes in preparation to commit in next step.
    - `git commit -m ""` - add your commit message inbetween the two quoatation marks, this explains the changes of your lastest version.
    - `git push` - this is the command that pushed your code up to your github repository.


### Forking a Github Repository:

- Instructions for forking a respositoty:
    - To fork a chosen repository, look towards the top right of the page, between the watch/unwatch tab and the star tab, and select the "Fork" tab.
    - By default, forks are named the same as the parent repository, however, you can change this as you see fit. You are also able to add an optional description.
    - Choose which branch you want to copy if you need to. Only the default branch is copied by default setting.
    - Click the green "Create Fork" button, and you will now have a forked repository to use.

### Locally Cloning a Github Repository:

- Instructions for cloning a repository:
    - To clone a repository, first you will need to select your chosen repository and look for the green "Code" button (located next to the "Go to file" and "Add file" buttons).
    - Next, copy the URL for the repository. By default this is a HTTPS link, however, you can copy an SSH key or by using the Github CLI.
    - After you have the URL, you are going to want to go to the terminal of your machine and cd (change directory) to the folder where you want to save your working directory to be.
    - In the terminal, type `git clone` followed by the url link you copied earlier.
    - Press enter and hopfully you will have successfully cloned the repository locally.
    - You will also need to make sure you have installed all the required packaged of the project. To do this, paste this code in to the terminal once your workspace is set up: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - You will also need to make an env.py file to run the project. Populate it with the required information, though make sure you include this file in the .gitignore file. The contents of the env.py file should NOT be made public.


#### Github docs:
- For further reading, I would highly suggest the Github Docs: [Github Docs Link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### Deployment through Heroku:

- Make sure you have a Heroku account before beginning with these steps.
- You should also make sure you have an AWS account with S3, and a Stripe Account for payments.

- Once logged in to Heroku, navigate to the personal dashboard and look for the 'New' dropdown button at top right hand corner of the page.
- In the drop down, select "Create new app - you will be taken to a page where you will be able to name the app and select a region. Once you have filled this information in, click the "Create app" button. Your app is now created.
- To pair an ElephantSQL (PostgreSQL) Database to your project, as I did to mine, see steps for this in the next section below. Alternatively, you can use a Heroku Postgres database.
- Next, you should navigate to the Settings tab to set up the config vars. Scroll down slightly to the button that reads "Reveal Config Vars" and click it to open it. We are going to need to add/remove the following information: 
    - DATABASE_URL: this should have been automatically generated by Heroku for you, but make sure it is populated already. Click add.
    - USE_AWS: should be set to True. Click add.
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: should be set to your AWS access key, click add.
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: should be set to your AWS secret key, click add.
    - EMAIL_HOST_PASS: In conjuntion with whichever email app provider you use. In my case, GMail and they provide you with a unique pass code to enter in to your config. Click add.
    - EMAIL_HOST_USER: this will be your email address. Click add.
    - SECRET_KEY: This should be a secret password, do not publish this anywhere. Click add.
     - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC: Should have been set to 1 during development. You will REMOVE this for full deployment. Click the 'x' to remove it. However, if you set up a dynamic DEBUG variable in settings.py, like so: `DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ`, you can remove it earlier.

- After this, head to the Deploy tab and scroll down to the Deployment Method section and select "Github"
- Next, in the "App connected to GitHub" section, look up your account and repo to pair it to the heroku app (click connect).
- Head to the bottom of the page where you will see a section called "Manual Deploy". Select the 'main' branch in the drop down and click the 'Deploy Branch' button.
- Wait for the deployment to complete, and when prompted, click the "View/Open App" button to see the launched site.

### Code Help:

The preliminary set up and an assisting walkthrough came in the form of following Code Institute's Boutique Ado walkthrough e-commerce project. Repository can be found here: [Boutique Ado - Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1)

I used the Bootstrap v5.0.2 framework to handle a lot of the heavy lifting of site styling and layout. 
The following from the documentation helped me:
- Navigation:
    - [Bootstrap 5 Navbar docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/)
    - [MD Bootstrap Navbar docs](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/navbar/#subsection-icons)
- Carousel:
    - [Bootstrap Carousel docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/)
- Cards: 
    - [Bootstrap Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/)


For general Bootstrap tips and information, I frequently referred to the [GetBootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) documentation, the [mdbootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/) documentation and the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php) bootstrap documentation.

Favicons were generated on [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) - I converted one of the checkered flag images I have (see images below) into a favicon using their site.

I made use of Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) using their free student plan. 
All icons used in this project have come from here.

Validator code for preventing previous dates from being set for creating trackdays found on stackoverflow: [Prevent past dates being set](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4941974/django-how-to-set-datefield-to-only-accept-today-future-dates)

I found the code for storing phone numbers in my models from stackoverflow as well: [Phone Number Validator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19130942/whats-the-best-way-to-store-a-phone-number-in-django-models)

I made a mock up of my checkout page using the template provided by [mdboostrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/credit-card/) - With this I was better able to visualise what I needed in my checkout page and how I wanted it to look.

Some of the logic for my increment/decrement buttons on the track day detail page were inspired by answers from this stackoverflow thread: [Stackoverflow js +/-](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9186346/javascript-onclick-increment-number)

CSS for a checkerboard pattern that I used in my FAQ's Page: [Checkerboard Pattern](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/css/s/checkerboard-pattern)

I used this Privacy Policy generator to make a section of the content on my Policies Page: [Django Raceway Privacy Policy](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/live.php?token=ZK35XedFzBkUqnjElVBI17mDCw2eViwQ)

## Personal Credits

- Many Thanks to my C.I Mentor Daisy McGirr, who has been guiding me and advising me through this project as well as all projects since PP2 - Her input in our mentor sessions has been instrumental in getting me this far and so I have to say I massive thank you to her for that!

- Thanks to Monika Hrda, for support with helping with the idea for a constraint on my trackday model and reminding me about the debug var in my settings.py file. A massive thanks to her for her support and chats on my project. I'm looking forward to working on some projects with Monika in future!

- Ben Dawson, for taking calls with me to discuss our P5 ideas at the project inception stage, and hosting check-in calls with me to see how we were getting on at different stages in our projects.

- Alan from C.I tutor support - helped me work out an issue with my AWS configuration where I was stuck and sat in front of my screen for over 3 hours! He is so patient, understanding and methodical and has also helped me to debug an issue I was having with my bootstrap 5 toasts. Thanks Alan! 

- Ed from Tutor Support - Also a member of the London C.I group, he helped me when I wasn't able to extract string values from my model choices. He introducted me to the get_FOO_display() method from the Django Docs, which did exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Ed!

- Scott from Tutor Support - Helped me with a bug with my add to basket functionality and explained why it was going wrong when he found it out himself. He is incredibly patient and kind and taught me a lot about dictionaries! Thanks Scott!
