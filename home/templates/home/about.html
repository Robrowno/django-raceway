    <p class="content text-wrap">Django Raceway is a motorsports venue located in the South of England. The circuit is
        host to several open and private track days every year along with hosting motorsports events and festivals for
        all to come and enjoy.
        The venue features and caters for a whole host of experience packages, tuition, a motorsports-themed cafe and a
        collection of superb track cars - all of which can be explored through information on the site or in person on
        arrival! Django Raceway aims to be the UK's Gold Standard for track day enthusiasts.</p>
    <h3 class="text-center">History:</h3>
    <p class="content text-wrap">Django Raceway was established back in 1983 by the Django Motorsports Group as a means
        to host British National Championships in respective rounds each year for various seasons.
        This included single seater champioships, touring car racing, sports car racing and some select motorbike
        championships. The original circuit had many talented drivers take to the tarmac in the 80's, many of whom would
        go on to progress up the motorsports ladder in to greater series.
        It is at this point that it should be mentioned that the original track layout is what we now call the National
        layout. In 1990 it was decided that cars were getting so much more powerful and advanced, that an extension
        should be built to account for this.
        From 1991, there would be three track variants moving forward, which could be tailored to different series
        requirements. Championship organisers now had the opportunity to pick between GP, National and Indy layouts.

    <p class="content text-wrap">Moving into the mid 90's, The Django Motorsport Group were experiencing financial
        difficulties and it became clear that that in order to survive it was going to have to find a new means of
        operating as a business beyond just hosting seasonal competitions. In what would arguably become the best
        decision the company would make since founding Django Raceway, it was decided that the best way to expand the
        business would be to offer track days to the public to test their own cars on a high-speed circuit.
        It began opening its doors to the public for the first open track day in 1996 and it has never looked back
        since. The circuit continued hosting championship events alongside its new-found track day business plan, and
        aimed to make sure it could continue to do both long into the future.

    <h3 class="text-center">Today:</h3>
    <p class="content text-wrap"> Today, Django Raceway primarily focuses on client trackdays, experiences and tuition
        over motorsports championship events. However, we do host several motorsports festivals over the course of the
        year where the most incredible racing cars head out on track.
        We offer track days on all 3 configurations of the circuit, along with different decibel limit days and various
        hospitality packages and options to make your track day cater to your needs.
        We also take requests for private trackdays for groups, which you can request on the track day request page.
        Our car collection which we have built up over several years allows us to offer different experience packages to
        try out different types of cars, or hire some of them out on track days.
        Our cars are meticulously maintained and perform to the highest level on track.

        Every year we invite over 15,000 people through our doors, and as such we strive to always improve on ourselves
        and exceed customer expectations.
        In 2022 we launched our own initiative to make sure we become more environmentally responsible. We are planting
        thousands of trees around the area, as well as joining a scheme to offset our carbon emmissions.
        We hope to become one of the first motorsports venues to offer synthetic carbon-neutral fuel this decade, and we
        are setting new targets for recycling and keeping the local area as clean as possible.
